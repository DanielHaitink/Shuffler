# Shuffler

Shuffler can be run with python 3 like so:```python3 shuffler.py path/to/data new/empty/destination/path```
This will create 5 folds in the second path.


You can also run it with an additional parameter, the number of folds. If you want to create a different amount of folds in the output directory.
The python call will then look like this:  ```python3 shuffler.py path/to/data new/empty/destination/path 3```

This time, the script will create just 3 folds instead of 5.
